# Unicode Unspoof ðŸ˜Ž

Just a little tool that helps to un-spoof unicode strings that contain spoofed characters.

This replaces almost equally looking characters from non-latin alphabets (e.g. Cyrillic) with their latin counterpart.

For example the unicode character `a` (`U+0430`) looks like a normal `a` (`U+0061`), but in fact it isn't.

The initial use-case of this tool was to revert spoofed unicode strings in online programming exams on moodle.
